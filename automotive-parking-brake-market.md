<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Parking Brake Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Drum Brake Type</li><li>Disc Brake Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive parking brake market comprises two primary types: drum brake and disc brake systems. Drum brakes utilize a cylindrical design, where braking is achieved through the friction of brake shoes pressing against the drum's inner surface. This type is often found in older vehicles and some compact cars. In contrast, disc brakes employ a flat rotor that the brake caliper squeezes, providing superior stopping power and heat dissipation. Disc brakes are increasingly favored in modern vehicles for their performance and reliability.</p></p>
