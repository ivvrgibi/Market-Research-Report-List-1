<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Firestop Cable Coating Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>IntumescentCableCoatings</li><li>Non-IntumescentCableCoatings</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Firestop Cable Coating market is categorized into two main types: Intumescent Cable Coatings and Non-Intumescent Cable Coatings. Intumescent coatings expand when exposed to heat, forming a protective char layer that insulates cables from fire, thereby enhancing fire resistance. Non-Intumescent coatings, on the other hand, do not expand but provide a barrier against flames and smoke, offering durability and protection in moderate fire scenarios. Both types play critical roles in ensuring the safety and integrity of electrical installations during fires.</p></p>
