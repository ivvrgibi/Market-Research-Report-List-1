<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Spine Bone Stimulators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive Stimulators</li><li>Non-Invasive Stimulators</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The spine bone stimulators market is divided into two main types: invasive and non-invasive stimulators. Invasive stimulators are surgically implanted devices that deliver electrical stimulation directly to the bone, promoting healing and enhancing fusion after spinal surgery. In contrast, non-invasive stimulators are external devices that provide stimulation through the skin using electromagnetic fields or ultrasound, facilitating bone growth without surgery. Both types aim to improve patient outcomes in spinal procedures by accelerating recovery and minimizing complications.</p></p>
