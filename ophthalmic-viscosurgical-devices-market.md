<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ophthalmic Viscosurgical Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dispersive</li><li>Cohesive</li><li>Combined</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Ophthalmic Viscosurgical Devices (OVDs) are categorized into three main types: dispersive, cohesive, and combined. Dispersive OVDs primarily provide protection and maintain space in the anterior chamber during surgical procedures, promoting smooth surgical handling. Cohesive OVDs, on the other hand, offer better visibility and easier removal but may not maintain chamber stability as effectively. Combined OVDs integrate the benefits of both types, providing protection and visibility, making them versatile for various ophthalmic surgeries.</p></p>
